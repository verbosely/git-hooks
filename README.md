# Git Hooks

This repository contains Bash programs that may be integrated into Git hook
workflows of teams throughout Verbosely to automate adherence to company-wide
standards. The name of a top-level directory indicates the type of hook whereby
its programs are intended to be executed. For example, programs in
[pre-commit/](pre-commit/) should be executed by the pre-commit Git hook.

## Requirements

**Operating System:** Ubuntu 22.04 or higher, Debian 12.0 or higher

**Packages:** *bash, coreutils, debianutils, file, git, grep, ncurses-bin, sed,
vim*

All packages reside in the main sections of the Debian and Ubuntu archives, and
they are thus Debian- or Canonical-maintained, respectively.
