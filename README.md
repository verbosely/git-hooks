# Git Hooks

This repository contains Bash programs that may be integrated into Git hook
workflows of teams throughout Verbosely to automate adherence to company-wide
standards. The name of a top-level directory indicates the type of hook whereby
its programs are intended to be executed. For example, programs in
[pre-commit/](pre-commit/) should be executed by the pre-commit Git hook.
